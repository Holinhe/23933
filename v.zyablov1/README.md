# You know...
'cause open repositories are for people finding code... temporarily...   

So you should grab it from anyone.   
And another one. Just copy it.  

# Check sugar
You can execute `scripts/delete_executables.sh` to clear repository from made programs.   
Note, scripts (in `scripts`):   
- `check_task_human.sh`   
- `execute_task_ai.sh`   
have ontion "--no-clean".
