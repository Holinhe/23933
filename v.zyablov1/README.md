# You know...
'cause open repositories are for people finding code... temporarily...   

So you should grab it from anyone.   
And another one. Just copy it.  

# Check sugar
For testing you can use those scripts:
- `check_task_human.sh`
- `execute_task_ai.sh`
Note, those scripts work only if some personality write corresponding file.  
And you can use "--no-clean" option to disable removing executable files
